How to produce plots
====================

How to run legend-data-monitor
------------------------------
After the installation, a executable is available at ``~/.local/bin``.
To automatically generate plots, two different methods are available.
All methods rely on the existence of a config file containing the output folder (``output``)
where to store results, the ``dataset`` you want to inspect, and the ``subsystems`` (pulser, geds, spms)
you want to study and for which you want to load data.

You can either run it by importing the ``legend-data-monitor`` module:

.. code-block:: python

  import legend-data-monitor as ldm
  user_config = path_to_config.json
  ldm.control_plots(user_config)

Or run it by parsing to the executable the path to the config file:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ legend-data-monitor user_prod --config path_to_config.json

.. warning::

  Use the ``user_prod`` command line interface for generating your own plots; ``auto_prod`` was designed to be used during automatic data production, for generating
  monitoring plots on the fly when processing data. For the moment, no documentation will be provided.


Configuration file
------------------
In the following, we describe the structure of the configuration file in detail.


Example config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: json

 {
  "output": "<some_path>/out", // output folder
  "dataset": {
    "experiment": "L200",
    "period": "p02",
    "version": "v06.00",
    "path": "/data1/users/marshall/prod-ref",
    "type": "phy",// data type (either cal, phy, or ["cal", "phy"])
    "start": "2023-02-07 02:00:00",  // time cut (here based on start+end)
    "end": "2023-02-07 03:30:00"
  },
  "subsystems": {
    "geds": { // type of subsystem to plot (geds, spms, pulser)
      "Baselines in pulser events": {
        "parameters": "baseline",
        "event_type": "pulser",
        "plot_structure": "per channel",
        "plot_style": "vs time",
        "variation": true,
        "time_window": "1H",
        "status": true
        }
      }
    }
  }

The argument ``output`` is the path to where plots and inspected data will be saved. Will create subfolders in given path for different outputs. Will be created if does not exist.

In particular, ``dataset`` settings are:

- ``experiment``: experiment, in uppercase (``L60`` or ``L200``);
- ``period``: format ``pXX``. Note: not needed for ``DataLoader`` as it finds period by itself based on provided selection (see below), only used in output filename;
- ``version``: version of production cycle, format ``vXX.YY``. Note: needed for ``DataLoader`` to look in the desired path;
- ``path``: path to ``prod-ref`` folder;
- ``type``: type of data, physics (``phy``) or calibration (``cal``). Possible to use one or both to make one dataset (``["phy", "cal"]``);
- ``selection``: time window to select data;

.. note::

  Time selection is based on:
  
  - ``'start': '2023-02-07 02:00:00', 'end': '2023-02-07 03:30:00'`` (start + end) in format ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss``;
  - ``'timestamps': ['20230207T103123Z', '20230207T141123Z', ...]`` (list of keys) in format ``YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ``;
  - ``'runs': 1`` (one run) or ``'runs': [1, 2, 3]`` (list of runs) in integer format.

..
  Note: currently taking range between earliest and latest i.e. also including the ones in between that are not listed, will be modified to either

  1. require only two timestamps as start and end, or
  2. get only specified timestamps (strange though, because would have gaps in the plot)

  The same happens with run selection.


Then, ``subsystems`` can either be ``pulser``, ``geds`` or ``spms`` (note, 2023-03-07: spms plots are not implemented yet, but DataLoader can load the respective data if needed).

For each subsystem to be plotted, specify

- ``"<some title>"``: the title of the plot you want to generate. eg. "Baselines in pulser events"
- ``parameters``: one or multiple parameters of interest to be plotted for this subsystem. In addition to any parameter present in ``lh5``, the following special parameters are implemented (see provided examples below for more details on how to select these parameters):
    - ``"K_lines"``: events whose energy is contained within 1430 and 1575 keV (40K and 42K regions)
    - ``"FWHM"``: FWHM values for each channel
    - ``"wf_max_rel"``: relative difference between ``wf_max`` and baseline
    - ``"event_rate"``: event rate calculated in windows specified in the field ``"sampling"`` under ``plotting.parameters``.
- ``"event_type"``: which events to plot. Choose among ``pulser``  (events flagged as pulser based on AUX channel), ``phy`` (physical, i.e. non-pulser events), ``K_lines`` (K lines selected based on energy) or ``all``.
- ``"plot_structure"``: plot arrangement. Choose among
    - ``per channel`` (pulser, geds): group plots by channel (ie each channel has its own AxesSubplot)
    - ``per cc4`` (geds): group plots by CC4 (ie all channels belonging to the same CC4 are in the same AxesSubplot)
    - ``per string`` (geds): group plots by string (ie all channels belonging to the same string are in the same AxesSubplot)
    - ``array`` (geds): group all channels in the same AxesSubplot
    - ``per fiber`` (spms): group channels separating them into IB and OB, and put top/bottom channels of a given fiber together to look for correlations within the fiber and among neighbouring fibers
    - ``per barrel`` (spms): group channels separating them into top/bottom IB/OB
- ``"plot_style"``: plot style. Choose among
    - ``vs time``: plot parameter VS time, as well as resampled values in window given in plot settings (see ``time_window``)
    - ``vs ch``: plot parameter VS channel ID
    - ``histogram``: plot distribution of given parameter
    - ``scatter``: plot all entries of a parameter with points
    - ``heatmap``: plot 2d histos, with time on x axis
- ``"variation"``: set it to ``True`` if you want % variation instead of absolute values for your parameter. Percentage variations are evaluated as: ``(param/mean - 1)*100``, where ``mean`` is the mean of the parameter under study evaluated over the first 10% of the time interval you specified in the ``dataset`` entry
- ``"time_window"``: resampling time (``T``=minutes, ``H``=hours, ``D``=days) used to print resampled values (useful to spot trends over time)
- ``"status"``: set it to ``True`` if you want to generate a status map for the subsystem and parameter under study (note, 2023-03-07: this works only for geds). In order to work, you first need to specify the limits you want to set as a either low or high threshold (or both) for the parameter under study by adding the % or absolute threshoold for the subsystem of interest in ``settings/par-setting.json``.

.. warning::

  There is no event type selection ready for calibration data.
  This means you always have to use ``"event_type": "all"`` as long as the different event selections are not properly implemented for calibration data too.

..
    "variation": Only implemented for ``"per_channel"`` plot style. Currently required even if the plot style is not ``"per_channel"``, will be fixed in the future.

More that one subsystem can be entered, for instance:

.. code-block:: json

  "subsystems": {
    "pulser": {
      "Pulser event rate": {
        "parameters": "event_rate",
        "event_type": "pulser",
        "plot_structure": "per channel",
        "plot_style": "vs time",
        "variation": false,
        "time_window": "1H"
      },
      "AUX channel waveform maximum": {
        "parameters": "wf_max",
        "event_type": "all",
        "plot_structure": "per channel",
        "plot_style": "histogram",
        "variation": false
      }
    },
    "geds": {
      "Baselines in pulser events": {
        "parameters": "baseline",
        "event_type": "pulser",
        "plot_structure": "per channel",
        "plot_style": "vs time",
        "variation": true,
        "time_window": "1H"
      }
    }

More examples can be found under ``examples/`` folder present in the Github repository.



Special parameters
------------------
More attention must be paid to the following special parameters, for which a particular ``subsystem`` entry is required.

K lines
~~~~~~~
To plot events having energies within 1430 and 1575 keV (ie, around the 40K and 42K area), grouping channels by string and selecting phy (=not-pulser) events, use

.. code-block:: json

    "subsystems": {
        "geds": {
          "K events":{
              "parameters": "cuspEmax_ctc_cal",
              "event_type": "phy",
              "cuts": "K lines",
              "plot_structure": "per string",
              "plot_style" : "scatter"
          }
        }
    }

FWHM
~~~~
To plot FWHM values for each channel, gropuing them by strings, selecting only pulser events, use

.. code-block:: json

    "subsystems": {
        "geds": {
          "FWHM in pulser events":{
              "parameters": "FWHM",
              "event_type": "pulser",
              "plot_structure": "array",
              "plot_style" : "vs ch"
          }
        }
    }

Relative maximum of the waveform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To plot the relative difference between ``wf_max`` and ``baseline``, use

.. code-block:: json

    "subsystems": {
        "pulser": {
            "Relative wf_max": {
                "parameters": "wf_max_rel",
                "event_type": "pulser", // or phy, all, ...
                "plot_structure": "per channel",
                "plot_style": "vs time",
                "variation": true, // optional
                "time_window": "5T"
            }
        }
    }

Event rate
~~~~~~~~~~
To plot the event rate, by sampling over a period of time equal to ``<time_window>`` (T=minutes, H=hours, D=days), use:

.. code-block:: json

    "subsystems": {
        "geds": {
            "Event rate": {
                "parameters": "event_rate",
                "event_type": "pulser",
                "plot_structure": "per channel",
                "plot_style": "vs time",
                "variation": false,
                "time_window": "5T"
            }
        }
    }
